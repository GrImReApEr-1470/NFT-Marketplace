The project is a decentralized marketplace for buying and selling Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) using blockchain technology. The marketplace is implemented using Solidity contracts that manage token ownership, auction management, and payment processing. Users can create auctions for their NFTs, and other users can bid on them. The highest bidder at the end of the auction period wins the NFT and pays the bid amount to the seller. The marketplace is decentralized, meaning that there is no central authority or intermediary controlling the transactions, and all transactions are verified and recorded on the blockchain.
